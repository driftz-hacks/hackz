# hackz
thank you for choosing this script this is simply for beginners. 
so it doesnt have much features but i hope you will still enjoy. 
it has only a couple features.
to run type 
cd (file you saved it in)
and then do 
cd hackz 
after that the final commands are 
cd hackz.py
and then type 
python3 hackz.py
